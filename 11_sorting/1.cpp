/*
criteria for analysis

1. No of comparisons
2. no of swaps
3. adaptive
4. stability
5. memory

/*
various sorting techniques
1. bubble
2. insertion
3. selection
4. heap
5. merge
6. quick
7. tree
8. shell

9. count 
10. bucket/bin
11. radix

1-8 are comparison based sorting
    1-3 takes o(n2) time and hence called as n2 sorting
    4-7 takes o(nlog(n)) and hence called as nloh n sorting
    8 takes o(n**1.5)

9-11 are index based sorting algorithms 
    they take o(n) time but consumes a lot of space so it a trade off
